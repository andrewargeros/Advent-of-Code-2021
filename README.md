# Advent of Code 2021
The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly challenge held each December to effectively give programmers, data scientists, and engineers some good-ol'-fashioned superiority complexes. Since there is nothing I love more than raw, unbridled competition, here are my entries.

## Day 1 -- [Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)

You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!

Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; there's a little meter that indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying 0-50 stars.
